Title: RAG Workshop
Description: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is an important technique for reducing the so-called 'hallucination' in AI-generated texts. In this workshop, we will invite experts such as Kai Jauslin and Germano Giuliani to consider how the RAG technique can be scaled and designed for different purposes.  
Type of event: Workshop
Duration: one-day workshop (approx. May or June 2026)
Budget request: 500 CHF for fees for lectures


Title: Building a Community for GLAM data and DH skills
Description:  As demonstrated by the activities of OpenGLAM-CH (https://glam.opendata.ch/), GLAM institutions hold a significant amount of cultural heritage data. This data is of great interest to academic researchers. On the other hand, the data should be 'open' to everyone. To make such data more visible and accessible, I suggest building a community to familiarise itself with the GLAM institution datasets and create use cases.
Specifically, we will run hands-on workshops and hold low-threshold meetings on a given theme in the Digital Library Space at the University Library, where gaming PCs with good GPUs are available. Some community members could participate in GLAMhack 2026. 
Type of event: Hands-on Workshops/meetings
Duration: a series of Workshops and community meetings (workshop series  (approx. 5 sessions) between Herbstsemester 2025; community meetings (approx. twice April/May 2026 and Sept./Oct. 2026)
Budget request: 1000 CHF for RENKU-usage

Title: Creating AI Software Prototypes to Support Academic Research
Description: This project builds on the idea that the DSI Community Libraries started: 'How can AI software support academic research?' Whether it's RAG techniques, multimodal AI, or AI agents, we'd like to continue exploring the potential of GenAI and create a couple of prototypes. In this context, we try to create one possible use case in a multimodal vector space, where not only text, but also different audio-visual media such as audio files and digital images, can be searched according to their semantic content. 
Type of event: project
Duration: one year project (this is a project in which a prototype of a software should be developed. Not an event)
Budget request: 0 CHF
