# DSI Community Digital Humanities
## Project Proposals 2026 (from Community Libraries)

**Digital Humanities & GLAM Data Initiatives**

---

## 1. RAG Workshop

### Overview
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is an important technique for reducing the so-called 'hallucination' in AI-generated texts.

<div class="highlight">

**Description**
In this workshop, we will invite experts such as **Kai Jauslin** and **Germano Giuliani** to consider how the RAG technique can be scaled and designed for different purposes.

</div>

**Type:** Workshop
**Duration:** One-day workshop (approx. May or June 2026)
**Budget:** 500 CHF for lecturer fees

## 2. Building a Community for GLAM Data and DH Skills

### Overview
GLAM institutions hold significant cultural heritage data of great interest to academic researchers and the public.


---

## Description
<div class="highlight">

As demonstrated by [OpenGLAM-CH](https://glam.opendata.ch/), we aim to build a community to familiarize itself with GLAM institution datasets and create use cases.

**Activities:**
- Hands-on workshops in the Digital Library Space at UB
- Low-threshold meetings on given themes
- Utilization of gaming PCs with good GPUs
- Potential participation in GLAMhack 2026
- Collaboration with other institutions, such as the DHd and the University of Basel

</div>

## 2. Building a Community (continued)

**Type:** Hands-on Workshops & Community Meetings

**Duration:**
- Workshop series: approx. 5 sessions during Herbstsemester 2025
- Community meetings: twice in April/May 2026 and twice in Sept./Oct. 2026

**Budget:** 1,000 CHF for RENKU-usage

## 3. Creating AI Software Prototypes to Support Academic Research

### Overview
Building on DSI Community Libraries' initiative: *"How can AI software support academic research?"*

<div class="highlight">

**Description**
We'll explore the potential of GenAI through RAG techniques, multimodal AI, and AI agents to create functional prototypes.

**Focus Area: Multimodal Vector Space**
Create a use case where not only text, but also different audio-visual media (audio files, digital images) can be searched according to their semantic content.

</div>

## 3. AI Software Prototypes (continued)

**Type:** Research & Development Project

**Duration:** One-year project focused on software prototype development

**Budget:** 0 CHF
